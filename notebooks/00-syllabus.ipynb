    "Emphasis is placed on neutron interactions in various nuclear core and shield configurations along with the development, solution, and analysis of the neutron balance equation for various situations. Several aspects of nuclear reactor core physics including neutron diffusion, criticality, power production, reactor kinetics, reactivity feedback and control, fuel depletion, fission product poisoning, and some energy removal considerations are treated. General reactor core design and safety considerations are also discussed.<br>\n",
