This site will be in construction during this semester.

This course uses Jupyter Notebooks in Python programming language. The content can be accessed in
the following ways:
+ Static HTML version of the notebooks will be displayed on the current browser if a 
notebook file listed in the code repository, `notebook/` is clicked on. This will not allow for rendering mathematical formulae. Alternatively you can render the notebooks on [NBViewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) by **clicking on the [![NBViewer](https://github.com/jupyter/design/blob/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dpploy/engy-5050/tree/main/notebooks/) badge above**.
+ Click on the `launch/binder` badge above to launch a Jupyter Notebook server for the
course notebooks. There will be a delay for the Binder cloud server to build a 
Python (Anaconda) programming environment for you. However once it is done, it will 
start a Jupyter Notebook server on your web browser with all notebooks listed. Upon 
clicking on individual notebook files, you will access the live course notebooks.
+ Use the green `Code` button above on the right upper side of the page and either download the repository using **GitHub Desktop** or download a **ZIP archive** to your local machine. Unzip the archive. Then use your own Jupyter Notebook server (*see Syllabus or Introduction notebooks on how to install Anaconda*) to navigate to the directory created by the unzip or GitHub Desktop operation and upload the notebook files. In the case of a ZIP download, the files will not be updated on your local machine and you will need to return to the repository for getting new files or updated versions of previously downloaded files as the course progresses. If you use GitHub Desktop, the repository will be in sync.

> *Students will profit from either taking or self-studying the [computational companion course Engy-5310](https://github.com/dpploy/engy-5310).*

Thanks in advance for inputs to improve this course.\

Prof. Valmor F. de Almeida
